MJPEG streamer is a linux tool for get pictures in jpeg format from webcameras using less CPU resource.

My goal was to create an application which is running on Win7 and can do the same.

It uses DirectX to get the images, and has a builtin webserver to serve the stream.

Shows debug info at runtime. Made for a contest called "Competition of Applied Engineering Science - Hungarians on the Mars" http://www.magyarokamarson.hu/.
